## Why Cypress?

One of the biggest [SDLC] (https://snyk.io/learn/sdlc-software-development-life-cycle/?utm_medium=Paid-Search&utm_source=google&utm_campaign=nb_ba_cnas&utm_content=sdlc&utm_term=sdlc&gclid=CjwKCAiA1uKMBhAGEiwAxzvX99WKQSVUUTPYfScMKqBtc9WUNyjEC61ipONjoRSBGA3PfkFwVfhl0xoCXzoQAvD_BwE) questions is how to test APIs and prepare data to interact with third-party servers.

Cypress provides the functionality to make an HTTP request. Using Cypressâ€™s Request() method, we can validate GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE API Endpoints.

## Usage requirement

To run this application you must have [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/about-npm) installed.

In the project, inside the [ cypress > integration ] folder we have the _api.spec.json_ file where all the test cases are.

Use `npx cypress open` to run all automated test scripts.
