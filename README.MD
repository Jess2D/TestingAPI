# Testing API Project :rocket:

This is API testing Project that uses Javascript and [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) framework. The purpose of API testing is to check functionality, reability, performance and securuty of programming interfaces.

## Assignment

Perform an automated test given the URL of an API and acceptance criteria.
1. API [URL](https://api.tmsandbox.co.nz/v1/Categories/6327/Details.json?catalogue=false)
2. Acceptance Criteria:
    - Name = "Carbon credits"
    - CanRelist = true
    - The Promotions element with Name = "Gallery" has a Description that contains the text "Good position in category"

## Why Cypress?

One of the biggest [SDLC](shorturl.at/apOR5) questions is how to test APIs and prepare data to interact with third-party servers.

Cypress provides the functionality to make an HTTP request. Using Cypressâ€™s Request() method, we can validate GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE API Endpoints.


## Usage requirements

To run this application you must have [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/about-npm) installed.

In the project, inside the [ cypress > integration ] folder we have the _api.spec.json_ file where all the test cases are.

Use `npx cypress open` to run all automated test scripts.


## Results 
All tests passed in just a few seconds of execution.
